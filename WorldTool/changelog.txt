The reason this update exists is because it fixes a lot of bugs and contains a lot of improvements.
I still have more features planned for version 0.6, so this serves as a sort of in-between version.

- Sneaking and throwing the general tool is now an alternative way to open the menu
- UI changes and fixes
- You can now select which alternating axises checkered uses
