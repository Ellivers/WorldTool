# WorldTool

WorldTool is a world-editing data pack with similar functionality to WorldEdit and BlingEdit. It has a large number of helpful features that make it so much easier to edit your Minecraft blocks, including rotation and a full system for automating editing using commands.

Here you can download non-full releases (experimental versions) to try out.

__This pack is multiplayer compatible, but it may not be as stable as in singleplayer.__

# Usage

Type `/function worldtool:give` to give yourself both tools; the general tool and the brush.
