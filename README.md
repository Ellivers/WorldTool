# WorldTool

WorldTool is a powerful and feature-rich world-editing Minecraft data pack.<br>
Here, you can download non-full releases (experimental versions) to try out.

To make some neat features possible, such as undoing, WorldTool uses [PlayerDB](https://github.com/rx-modules/PlayerDB).

# Usage

Type `/function worldtool:give` to give yourself all tools.
