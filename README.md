# WorldTool

***This branch is currently being reworked and will be pretty buggy and not have all features for a while. If you want to clone the current version with all features, please check out the [old branch](https://github.com/Ellivers/WorldTool/tree/old) instead.***

WorldTool is a world-editing data pack with similar functionality to WorldEdit and BlingEdit. It has a large number of helpful features that make it so much easier to edit your Minecraft blocks, including rotation and a full system for automating editing using commands.

Here you can download non-full releases (experimental versions) to try out.

__This pack is multiplayer compatible, but it may not be as stable as in singleplayer.__

# Usage

Type `/function worldtool:give` to give yourself both tools; the general tool and the brush.
