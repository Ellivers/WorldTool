# WorldTool

WorldTool is a world-editing Minecraft data pack, with functionality similar to that of WorldEdit and BlingEdit. It comes packed with a ton of helpful features and is sure to help you with your editing needs.

Here you can download non-full releases (experimental versions) to try out.

# Usage

Type `/function worldtool:give` to give yourself both tools; the general tool and the brush.
