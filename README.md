# WorldTool

A world editing datapack similar to WorldEdit or BlingEdit.

This datapack adds two tools with tons of functionality, as well as a command system to make editing your world as easy as pie. 
It has a lot more than the default vanilla editing system (fill, clone, etc.).

__Keep in mind that multiplayer support has not been tested yet.__

Usage:
Type `/function worldtool:give` to give yourself both tools; the general tool and the brush.
