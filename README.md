# WorldTool

WorldTool is a world-editing data pack with similar functionality to WorldEdit and BlingEdit. It has a large amount of helpful features that make it so much easier to edit your Minecraft blocks, including a full system for automating editing using commands.

Here you can download non-full releases (experimental versions) to try out.

__Keep in mind that multiplayer support has not been tested yet.__

Usage:
Type `/function worldtool:give` to give yourself both tools; the general tool and the brush.
