# WorldTool

WorldTool is a world-editing data pack with similar functionality to WorldEdit and BlingEdit. It has a large number of helpful features that make it so much easier to edit your Minecraft blocks, including rotation and a full system for automating editing using commands.

Here you can download non-full releases (experimental versions) to try out.

__This pack is multiplayer compatible, but it may not be as stable as in singleplayer.__

# Usage

Type `/function worldtool:give` to give yourself both tools; the general tool and the brush.

To use this in **1.17 snapshots**, extract the data pack's files into a folder, open it with your file editing tool of choice (e.g VSCode), then turn on Regex expressions and replace `replaceitem (entity @.[^[]*? .*? |entity @.\[.*?\] .*? |block (.*? ){4})` with `item $1replace `. Make sure to include the space at the end there.
